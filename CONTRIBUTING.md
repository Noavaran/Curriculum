# Contributing to Curriculum

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in SLACK ([curriculum-fans](https://curriculum-fans.slack.com/) on slack). We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Noavaran/Curriculum/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
